## Description  
This project analyzes bikeshare data from Chicago, New York City, and Washington, allowing users to explore trends in bike usage.  
It enables users to filter data by city, month, and day to generate statistics on popular travel times, stations, and trip durations.  
The program calculates key metrics such as the most common travel hours, frequently used start and end stations, and total travel time.
